# Snake_Game_
Game Components
1. Game Board: This is the area where the game is played. It will be implemented using a JPanel.
2. Snake: Represented as a series of coordinates. Initially, it will have a length of a few segments.
3. Food: Appears randomly on the board. When the snake eats the food, it grows longer and new food appears.


Game Logic
1. Movement: The snake continuously moves in the current direction until the player changes direction.
2. Collision Detection: The game checks if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
3. Food Consumption: If the snake's head reaches the food, the snake grows and new food appears.
